This repository is a collection of all the homework I did throughout the year in Java. In addition to that, there were several assignments 
that I did some extra work on and even did some extra projects, which I included in this repository as well. 

I tried to make the names as neat as possible, so I changed them up a little bit in order to try and get some background on what I know; 
however, there are more topics we covered, but that we didn't do any assignments on such as: File I/O and some Data Structure concepts.
